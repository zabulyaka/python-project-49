# Brain-games
A collection of simple games, where you have to use ~~a little luck~~ **>>MATH<<** to give the right answer. The game consists of three rounds, in each one you have to answer correctly, otherwise, you loose!

Begin with cloning the repository into your device. See below instruction for [installation](#installation) as well as short [descriptions](#game-list-and-descriptions) of the games. In the bottom of the page there are short video [clips](#brain-even) with demonstration of the process of installation and running games.

Have fun!

### Installation:
Once you have the directory cloned and unpacked on your device, do the following steps:

Open the terminal window in your OS and open python-project-49 directory in the terminal. Then type:

`make install`

`make build`

`make package-install` (This will install the package to run the game through terminal)

`brain-even` (To run the game) 

(To choose a different game, type the name of the game e.g. "brain-calc")

### Game list and descriptions:
- Brain-even - *guess even number*

- Brain-calc - *calculate the result of an expression*
